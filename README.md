# Unclosed Div Tag in HTML: A Common Yet Tricky Bug

This repository demonstrates a common, yet easily overlooked, HTML error: a missing closing tag for a div element.  While seemingly minor, this error can lead to unexpected rendering issues and make debugging more challenging. The `bug.html` file shows the error, while `bugSolution.html` provides the corrected version.

**The Problem:**
The `bug.html` file contains an unclosed `<div>` tag.  Browsers will attempt to recover from this, but may not render the page as intended, particularly in more complex layouts.

**The Solution:**
The `bugSolution.html` file corrects the error by simply adding the closing tag `</div>`.  This ensures that the HTML is properly structured and rendered correctly.
